Welcome to my site! 
Here are few words about me:
I started initially a ForTran and pascal programmer, as a typical physics undergraduate student. During the 2 years of study for the postgraduate degree in Environmental physics and Meteorology, of the University of Athens, I switched to applying arithmetic analysis schemes in modeling of physical,  phenomena using parallel computing technologies, such as the C libraries of MPI and Sun Solaris.
I started using Oracle and Java, in 2003.
Since then, some more exams have been passed: Certified Oracle 9i DB Associate, Sun Certified Java Programmer for the 1.4 platform, CompTIA Project+ certified professional, state certified IT Technician.
As far as previous experience is concerned, I have participated in large Greek and German public sector projects, having stakeholders such as the Deutsche Bahn, Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit, the greek Ministry of marine navigation, Ministry of economics and finance, Ministry of transport, national telecommunication organization (OTE group), the Greek Army,the Municipality of Athens Greece and lastly the National Radio Television Council (ESR).
